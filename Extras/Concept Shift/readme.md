Concept Shift is observed when we trained the RL agent on base NUT model and let it find most important concepts. We then finetuned the NUT to increase its perfomance and see the change in the most important concepts. We observed that the most important concepts changed after finetuning. In this folder we have provided the weights of the finetuned RestNet50 model (NUT in this experiment). Although the main pipeline code remains unchanged, the weights of the model used are different.
